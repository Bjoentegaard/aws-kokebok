# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials
[AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/94T2BEN85A/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials/8D79F3AVR7?parentId=Y4YASRJEVX)

## Module 1 - Intorduction to the cloud
- `Cloud Computing` - On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with a Pay-as-you-go pricing
- `Cloud-based deployment:` Resources and applications are hosted entirely in the cloud and accessed over the internet.
- `On-premises deployment:` Resources and infrastructure are hosted and managed locally within the organization's data center.
- `Hybrid deployment`: A combination of on-premises and cloud environments, offering balance between control and scalability.
- `Six key benefits of cloud computing`
  - Trade fixed expense for variable expense
  - Benefit from massive economies of scale
  - Stop guessing capacity
  - Increase speed and agility
  - Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
- `AWS Regions` - Physical locations around the world that contain groups (AZ) of data centers (Min 3)
- `Availability Zones (AZ)` - Consists of one or more data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
- `Customer responsibilites` - Security IN the cloud (applications, data, access control)
- `Shared responsibilites` - Varies by service
- `AWS Responsibilities` - Security OF the cloud (hardware, infrastructure)

## Module 2 - Compute in the cloud
- `Compute in the cloud` - Compute in the cloud means creating virtual machines with a cloud provider to run applications and tasks over the internet
- `Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)` - Virtual Server/Machine in the AWS Cloud that provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity
- `EC2 Instances types`
  - General purpose - Balanced resources 
  - Compute optimized - Compute intensive tasks
  - Memory optimized - Provide fast performance for memory-heavy workloads
  - Accelerated computing - Uses HW acceleators to efficiently handle tasks
  - Storage optimized - Designed for workloads that require high performance for lacally stored data
- `AWS Management Console` - Web interface for managing AWS services
- `AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)` - Managing multiple AWS services directly from the command line.
- `AWS Software Development Kit (SDK)` - Simplifies integrating AWS services into your applications by providing APIs for various programming languages.
- `Amazon Machine Images (AMI)` - AMIs are pre-built VM that have the basic components for what is needed to start an instance.
  - It provides a consistent image to launch new instances.
  - With an _unmanaged_ service like EC2, you are responsible for configuring and managing security.
- `EC2 Pricing`
  - On-Demand Instances - Pay only for the compute capacity you consume with no upfront payment or long-term commitments required.
  - Reserved Instances - Get a saving of up to 75 percent by committing to a 1-year or 3-year term for predictable workloads using specific instance families and AWS Regions
  - Spot Instances - Bid on a spare compute capacity at up to 90 percent of the On-demand price, with the flexibility to be interrupted when AWS reclaims the instance
  - Savings Plans - Save up to 72 percent across a variety of instance types and services by commiting to a consistent usage level for 1 or 3 year.
  - Dedicated Hosts - Reserve an entire physical server for your exclusive use. This option offers full control and is ideal for workloads with strict security or licensing needs
  - Dedicated Instances - Pay for instances running on HW dedicated solely to your account. This option provides isolation from other AWS customers.
- `Cost optimization`
  - Saving Plans - Good for Predictable workloads
  - Capacity Reservation - Good for Critical workloads with strict capacity requirements
  - Reserved Instance flexibility - Good gor Steady-state workloads with predictable usage
- `Scalability` - Adding Resources
  - Scaling Up (Vertical) - Adding more power to existing machines
  - Scaling Out (Horizontal) - Adding more machines
- `Elasticity` - Abilitiy to automatically scale resources up or down in response to real-time demand
- `EC2 Auto Scaling` - automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on changes in application demand, providing better availability. It offers two approaches. 
  - Dynamic scaling adjusts in real time to fluctuations in demand. 
  - Predictive scaling preemptively schedules the right number of instances based on anticipated demand.
- `Auto Scaling Group` - Configured with three key settings (**min, desired and max** capacity)
  -   - A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to an Auto Scaling group.
- `Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)` - automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as EC2 instances, to optimize performance and reliability.
  - Regional application
- `ELB Benefits`
  - Efficient traffic distribution - ELB evenly distributes traffic across EC2 instances, preventing overload on any single instance and optimizing resource utilization.
  - Automatic Scaling - ELB scales with traffic and automatically adjusts to changes in demand for a seamless operation as backend instances are added or removed.
  - Simplified management - ELB decouples front-end and backend tiers and reduces manual synchronization. It also handles maintenance, updates, and failover to ease operational overhead.
- `ELB Routing Methods`
  - Round Robin - Distributes traffic evenly across all available servers in a cyclic manner.
  - Least Connections - Routes traffic to the server with the fewest active connections, maintaining a balanced load.
  - Ip Hash - Uses the clientâ€™s IP address to consistently route traffic to the same server.
  - Least Response Time - Directs traffic to the server with the fastest response time, minimizing latency.
- `Monolitich Applications` - Applications consist of multiple components that work together to transmit data, fulfill requests, and keep the application running smoothly.
- `Microservices Applications` - Application components are loosely coupled. The communication between components remains intact, and the failure of a single component does not impact the entire system.
- `EventBridge` - A serverless service that helps connect different parts of an application using events, helping to build scalable, event-driven systems. 
  - With EventBridge, you route events from sources like custom apps, AWS services, and third-party software to other applications. 
- `Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)` - A message queuing service that facilitates reliable communication between software components.
  - It can send, store, and receive messages at any scale, making sure messages are not lost and that other services don't need to be available for processing
- `Payload` - Data contained within a message
- `Amazon SQS queues` - Where messages are placed until they are processed
- `Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)` - A publish-subscribe service that publishers use to send messages to subscribers through SNS topics.
- `Amazon SNS topic` - A channel for messages to be delivered
