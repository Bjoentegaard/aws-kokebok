# Section 3: What is Cloud Computing

## Traditional IT Overview
- Websites operate by clients using networks to send requests to servers identified by IP addresses.
- Servers consist of CPU, RAM, storage, and networking components essential for processing and data management.
- Traditional IT involved hosting servers physically in homes or data centers, which posed challenges in scaling, maintenance, and disaster recovery.
- Cloud computing externalizes infrastructure management, providing scalable and on-demand resources.

## What is Cloud Computing ?
- Cloud computing provides on-demand delivery of computing resources with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- It offers flexibility to provision exactly the right type and size of resources instantly.
- There are different cloud deployment models: `private`, `public`, and `hybrid clouds`.
- Cloud computing delivers benefits such as `scalability`, `cost efficiency`, `agility`, and `high availability`.

## The Different Types of Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing is categorized into `Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)`, `Platform as a Service (PaaS)`, and `Software as a Service (SaaS)`.
- `IaaS` provides raw building blocks such as networking, computers, and data storage, offering high flexibility.
- `PaaS` removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure, allowing focus on application deployment and management.
- `SaaS` delivers fully managed products run by service providers, requiring no management from users.
- AWS and other providers offer services corresponding to each cloud computing type.
- Cloud pricing follows a `pay-as-you-go model`, `charging based on compute time`, `storage used`, and `outbound data transfer`.

## AWS Cloud Overview
- AWS was launched internally in 2002 and publicly in 2004 with SQS, expanding to S3 and EC2 in 2006.
- AWS operates globally with multiple `regions` and `availability zones`, enabling scalable and sophisticated applications.
- Choosing an AWS region depends on factors like `compliance`, `latency`, `service availability`, and `pricing`.
- AWS has over 400 points of presence (400+ edge locations) worldwide to deliver content with low latency.

## Shared Responsibility Model & AWS Acceptable Policy
- The Shared Responsibility Model defines the division of security responsibilities between AWS and the customer.
- Customers are responsible for `security "in" the cloud`, `including data`, `operating systems`, `network`, and `firewall configurations`.
- AWS is responsible for `security "of" the cloud`, including `infrastructure`, `hardware`, `software`, and `internal security`.
- Users must comply with AWS's Acceptable Use Policy, prohibiting illegal, harmful, offensive, or abusive activities.
